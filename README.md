# Snake-Matrix
This repository includes the main project for the '**Introduction to Robotics**' course, taken in the third year at the _Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest_. It comes documentation, source code, setup images and demonstartive video.

## Backstory
When thinking about this project, a lot of game ideas came to mind, like space invaders or car racers. Although all of these are great ideas, I soon realised that they wouldn't have been achievable in the time given, as this is my first big project using Arduino. A lot of weird problems and glitches arose that I just didn't know quite yet how to manage, so, in order to achieve a good result and complete my tasks in the best possible way, I chose _Snake_. Simple, yet fun, it proved to be, for me, a reasonable challenge from which I learned a lot. (I also like snakes :p).

## Description
This games simulates an old arcade snake game. Using the joystick in order to move, the goal is to eat as many apples as you can. With each apple that you eat, the snake's lenght increases, thus the main challenge being avoid your tail (in which case, it's game over).

## How to play
After entering the main menu, select 'Start game!' and press to start playing. Use the joystick to change direction. Press the joystick again to end the game early.

  <summary > <h2>Task requirements</h2> </summary>
  <h3> Menu task </h3>
    Create an interactive (scrolling) menu on the LCD. Incorporate the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Start game</li>
        <li>Highscore (leaderboard)</li>
        <li>Settings</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>How to play</li>
      </ul>
   <h3> Game task </h3>
   Create a game with the minimal components (an LCD, a joystick, a buzzer and the led matrix). Add basic sounds. Be sure it makes sense in the current setup and it is <i>fun to play</i>.
